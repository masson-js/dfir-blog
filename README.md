# üëã Welcome to My DFIR Repository!

Hey there! I'm Masson, and this is my GitHub repository dedicated to my Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) journey, where I'll document my progress, share projects, and build a portfolio.

Depository Structure:





Understand core DFIR concepts: digital forensics, incident response, malware analysis, and log analysis.



Get familiar with tools like Autopsy, Volatility, Wireshark, and FTK Imager.



Study file systems, memory forensics, and network traffic analysis.



Hands-On Practice:





Complete beginner-friendly CTFs (Capture The Flag) focused on forensics and incident response.



Work on labs and simulations (e.g., TryHackMe, HackTheBox, or Blue Team Labs Online).



Experiment with open-source datasets and tools to analyze logs, memory dumps, and disk images.



Build a Portfolio:





Document my projects here on GitHub (e.g., forensic reports, scripts, or incident response playbooks).



Create detailed write-ups for each project, explaining my approach, tools used, and lessons learned.



Showcase skills like evidence collection, chain of custody, and incident reporting.



Stay Curious:





Follow DFIR blogs, podcasts, and communities (e.g., SANS, DFIR.training, AboutDFIR).



Join Discord or Reddit communities to connect with other DFIR enthusiasts.



Keep up with the latest threats and techniques in cybersecurity.



üìÇ Portfolio Plan

My portfolio will consist of projects that demonstrate my growing expertise in DFIR. Each project will be documented in this repository with a clear structure:





Project Title: A brief, catchy name for the project.



Objective: What I aimed to achieve (e.g., analyze a memory dump, investigate a phishing incident).



Tools Used: List of tools (e.g., Volatility, Wireshark, Autopsy).



Process: Step-by-step explanation of what I did.



Findings: Key discoveries or results.



Lessons Learned: What I gained from the project and how it improved my skills.

Example Project Ideas





Memory Forensics Challenge: Analyze a memory dump to identify malicious processes using Volatility.



Log Analysis Lab: Investigate suspicious activity in server logs using Splunk or ELK Stack.



Disk Image Analysis: Recover deleted files from a disk image using Autopsy or FTK Imager.



Network Forensics: Analyze a PCAP file to detect a data exfiltration attempt with Wireshark.



Incident Response Playbook: Create a step-by-step guide for responding to a ransomware incident.



üõ†Ô∏è Tools I'm Exploring

Here are some tools I plan to learn and use in my DFIR projects:





Forensic Analysis: Autopsy, FTK Imager, Magnet AXIOM



Memory Forensics: Volatility, Rekall



Network Analysis: Wireshark, Network Miner



Log Analysis: Splunk, ELK Stack, Graylog



Scripting: Python (for automation and parsing logs), PowerShell



Other: Chain of custody documentation, hashcat for password recovery



üìö Learning Resources

These are the resources I'm using to kickstart my DFIR journey:





Courses: TryHackMe (DFIR paths), SANS FOR508, Blue Team Labs Online



Books:





The Art of Memory Forensics by Michael Hale Ligh



Practical Malware Analysis by Michael Sikorski



Incident Response & Computer Forensics by Jason T. Luttgens



Communities: r/DFIR, DFIR Discord, AboutDFIR



Practice Platforms: HackTheBox, TryHackMe, LetsDefend



üöÄ What's Next?





Complete my first DFIR-focused CTF and post the write-up here.



Set up a home lab to practice forensic analysis (e.g., using VirtualBox with sample disk images).



Write a Python script to parse logs or automate a DFIR task.



Share my progress regularly in this repo to stay accountable.



ü§ù Get Involved!
